# Shell Password Manager

<p>This is a very simple password manager in shell, that uses:</p>

- Python
- SQLite
- bcrypt
- cryptography
- peewee
- prettytable

<p>I was curious about how to really build a password manager, that can unlock one password with another.</p>
<p>Through this little practice, I learned how to do it, and it was great!!</p>

#

<p>To run the code, execute the following commands:</p>

```
git clone https://github.com/Aumaca/Shell-Password-Manager.git
&&
cd ./Shell-Password-Manager
&&
pip install -r requirements.txt
&&
python src/main.py
```
