# Shell Password Manager

<p>This is a very simple password manager in shell, that uses:</p>
- Python
- SQLite
- bcrypt
- cryptography
- peewee
- prettytable

<p>I was curious about how to really build a password manager, that can unlock one password with another.</p>
<p>Through this little practice, I learned how to do it, and it was great!!</p>
